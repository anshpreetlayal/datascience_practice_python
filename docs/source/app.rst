app module
==========

This module documentation is generated using Sphinx directives.

.. automodule:: app
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

Directive Explanation:

- :automodule:: app: This directive instructs Sphinx to automatically generate documentation for the Python module named `app`.

- :members:: This option tells Sphinx to document all members (functions, classes, variables) found in the `app` module.

- :undoc-members:: With this option, Sphinx includes undocumented members in the generated documentation. Undocumented members are those lacking docstrings or descriptions.

- :show-inheritance:: This option includes information about inheritance in the documentation, displaying base classes from which classes might be derived.
